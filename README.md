# ViewDiscordContents
View Discord File Contents Instead Of Downloading Them.

All credits go to [@art0007i](https://github.com/art0007i) for actually figuring the code out.
I just ported it to firefox, it was really simple though. So go follow art.

# Installation

For Firefox users the preferred installation method would be by the addons store. [Download the extension!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/view-discord-contents/)

Otherwise, install the extension using the manifest.json in the folder with extension debugging enabled.

For Chrome, install by enabling developer mode in the Chrome extension page. Then select "Load Unpacked" and select the Chrome folder.
